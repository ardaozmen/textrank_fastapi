## Keyword Extraction using TextRank algorithm with FastApi



### Overview

- This project is an implementation of the TextRank algorithm for keyword extraction and its deployment using FastAPI. The algorithm uses a graph-based approach to identify the most important keywords in a given text.


> :warning: **Note**: This algorithm does not actually perform summarization, as it selects top sentences without regard for their position or order in the original text.
